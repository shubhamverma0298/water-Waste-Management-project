Waste Management and Recycling in Indian Cities
Project Overview
This project is a submission for the PWSkills Mini-Hackathon on "Waste Management and Recycling in Indian Cities." The objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the "Recycling Rate (%)" for various Indian cities based on a set of given features. The solution includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and an optional Flask-based web application for deployment.

The primary goal of the model is to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the code.

1. Clone the repository
git clone <(https://github.com/shubhamverma0298/water-Waste-Management-project.git)>
cd <your-repository-name>


3. Install dependencies
Install all the necessary libraries using the provided requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the notebooks
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the Notebooks/ folder in the following order to perform the data science pipeline:

data_preparation.ipynb

exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb

model_training.ipynb

This will generate the processed_dataset.csv file in the data/processed folder and the trained_model.pkl file in the models folder.

Running the Prediction Script
To make predictions on the test dataset and generate the predictions.csv file, run the prediction script from the project root:

python src/models/predict.py


This will create a predictions.csv file in the project's root directory, which can be submitted for evaluation.

Running the Flask Application (Optional)
If you have completed the web deployment part, you can run the Flask application to see the model in action.

Make sure you have a trained_model.pkl file in the models/ directory.

Run the application from the project root:

python src/app.py


Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the application.
